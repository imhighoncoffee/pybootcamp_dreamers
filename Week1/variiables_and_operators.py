#each variable can change its type

# BASIC OPERATORS
# + Addition	Adds values on either side of the operator.	a + b = 31
# - Subtraction	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	a â€“ b = -11
# * Multiplication	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	a * b = 210
# / Division	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	b / a = 2.1
# % Modulus	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	b % a = 1
# ** Exponent	Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	a**b =10 to the power 20
# //	Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. 
#     But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity):
# 	9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0
